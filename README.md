# Botmother

# Aim
- Allow students to ask **module-specific** questions and get **timely** and **accurate** replies. 
   - E.g. "Is it a good idea to take CS2100 in Semester 2?"
- Store questions-answer pairs in a **question bank**, and display them for each module to enable ease-of-revision and conceptual linking between similar questions
- Provide **chat-like interfaces** for these actions - such as a Telegram Bot.

# Why?
Everyone is eternally grateful to Stackoverflow/Quora/Forums in general, but university-going students demand a fast-paced learning environment. These traditonal methods either require the use of a browser or an additional app, but students likely already have Telegram or Whatsapp on their phones. A chat environment like Telegram allows for notifications, instant feedback, and a module-based system lets students see questions that are immediately relevant to their situation.
